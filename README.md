###Refactored 2018

### Stock Performance
Looking at the analysis for both years, we can see that only two stocks provide positive returns for both 2017 and 2018.  Those two stocks are ENPH and RUN. ENPH can almost claim the highest return percentage for the combined period.

### Refactored Code Performance
Refactoring the code provided a substantial increase in performance.  For each year, the refactored code ran in less than one tenth the time of the original code.  This equated to only half of a second. Although, saving half of a second would not be noticeable, with a larger data set it could save significant amounts of time and computing power.

## Summary

### Advantages Refactoring Code
Refactoring code provides a working starting point with the potential for improvement. This can save time compared to writing code from scratch. Refactoring can provide performance improvements as code is cleaned up and simplified over time. Another benefit of refactoring code is the ability to quickly implement new functionality.

### Disadvantages Refactoring Code
When refactoring code the original coder may no longer be working on the project. This can be a disadvantage.  Even if the coder is the same individual, time between work on a given project could provide some hurdles.  To help overcome these obstacles it is best to provide an abundance of clear notes within the code as it is written.

### Refactoring the Original
When refactoring the original VBA script, I had a difficult time reconnecting with the project after some time away from it. However, once the code was refactored it was a much better product.
